Hi Everyone, I am Steve Liu, and here is the repo for the Shiny App I created using R. 

The App is called "The Iris Explorer", which allows users to explore the Dataset "Iris" freely by themselves. Specifically, based on the species of iris that user selects, it will output the number of observations left and produce histograms for each explanatory variables with adjustable bin-numbers. Meanwhile, the statistical summary of filtered data will also be provided.

Regarding the "Iris" dataset, it is one of the earliest and most famous datasets for classification and it is a built-in dataset in R. It gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The data were collected by Anderson, Edgar (1935). The irises of the Gaspe Peninsula, Bulletin of the American Iris Society, 59, 2â€“5.
